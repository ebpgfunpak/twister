# twister
This python program allows you to exceed the 0.2 degree rotation limit for alignment with the ebpg. It measures the positions of four marks, then rotates a pattern (with Freebeam) before exposure.
Twister.py performs one level of global alignment and then exposes the pattern. Read and edit the top of the python file to set the parameters.
