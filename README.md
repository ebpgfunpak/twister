# twister
This bash script allows you to exceed the 0.2 degree rotation limit for alignment with the ebpg. It measures the positions of four marks, then rotates a pattern (with Freebeam) before exposure.
Twister.sh performs one level of global alignment and then exposes the pattern. Read and edit the top of the python file to set the parameters. Requires Freebeam, python3, cview. 
Includes several small python programs for calculating rotations.
